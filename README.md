# HangmanProject
A game that makes a player guess a word by guessing it, one letter at a time.
When the player guesses a letter wrongly he loses one life.
The game ends when the player runs out of lives or when the player succesfully guesses the word.
I used python libraries such as random to introduce randomness into the game, as well used the powerful selection methods of numpy arrays to find and replace letters.

## Milestone 1
I cloned a github repository `Hangman_Test` to obtain a template code.
Used the in-built python function `input` to ask the user of the game for an input
